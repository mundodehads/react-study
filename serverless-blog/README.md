# Serverless Blog

## About

This blog was made for study purpose, I decide to apply React for the frontend and for the database I choose to use MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Stitch, as the main reason for me to create this repository is to study stitch as a mongodb serverless database to replace DynamoDB use.

## Running

You wont be able to run this project locally without having an Atlas | Stitch structure configured (and node 8+), but if you already have one, follow these steps:

1. On the project folder, install the project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Start the local front-end server:

```
npm install
```
